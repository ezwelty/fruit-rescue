      Confirm your plans with the homeowners, then publish your itinerary to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1hzZPTNc4u70sjYXx5uRIqR9rBclnFuuvJZkU01u5R84/viewform">Events Form</a>.

    <ul>
      <li>If you can bring ⅓ of the fruit to one of our <a>recipients</a>, schedule the harvest whenever is most convenient.
      <li>If you need us to deliver the donated fruit, schedule the harvest on a Sunday and plan to be finished by 3pm. Volunteers will pick up the fruit between 3-5pm.
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>We recommend planning to visit only 1 site per 2-hour harvest time slot because most people leave after harvesting 1 site. However, if two sites are very close, feel free to plan harvests to both on the same day. (Consider the # and size of trees at each site and distance between sites. A good rule of thumb is ~30-45 mins./tree per 10 people.)

    <hr>
  
    <p>
      Thank you for stepping up to organize a fruit harvest at your home! Below are the suggested steps to organize your harvest:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Decide on the date and time for your fruit harvest based on your availability and when your tree’s fruit is expected to be ripe.
        <ul>
          <li>If you can take ⅓ of the fruit harvested to a Fruit Rescue recipient, feel free to schedule the harvest whenever is most convenient to you.</li>
          <li>If you need Boulder Food Rescue to come by to pick up the ⅓ of the fruit harvested for those in need, please plan to hold your harvest on Sunday to be finished by 3pm, so that volunteers can come pick up the fruit between 3-5pm.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Please fill out this form to let us know your harvest plans as soon as possible, so we can email harvesters about harvest times/locations.  (We’ll send out emails each week during the harvest season to registered harvesters with Fruit Rescue meetup locations, including coordinators’ first names and phone #s in case they can’t find you.)</li>
    </ol>
  
    <p>
      Before the event, pull together equipment for the harvest:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Description of activity/safety tips - to share when harvesters arrive.</li>
      <li>Sign in sheet and pen for harvesters - so we know who participated.
      <li>Extra liability forms and pens- in case anyone didn't sign one online - print them out.
      <li>Bathroom scales - to weigh fruit so we know about how much we're harvesting - approximate weight is fine, doesn't need to be totally accurate. Works best to weigh your self with and without the fruit and then subtract off the difference.
      <li>Fruit weight sheet and pen - for harvesters to enter the weight of the fruit they harvest for our records before they split it between themselves, the homeowner, and the charity pile (weight sheet attached to this email)
      <li>5-10 Large boxes and/or tarps to put 1/3 of the fruit to go to charity in/on.
      <li>Optional: A few extra grocery bags or boxes in case anyone forgets theirs.
      <li>Optional: A ladder and fruit harvesting poles if possible. Community Fruit Rescue will have a few poles to loan on a first-come, first-serve basis. Let us know if you would like to borrow some, and we will let you know where to pick them up.
      <li>Optional: Invite your friends - create a Facebook event page, email friends, and call friends! :)  Encourage them to register at fruitrescue.org/join so they receive email reminders and sign the liability form online (and save your paper).
    </ol>
  
    <p>
      During the Community Fruit Rescue event:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Be ready at least 15 minutes before the event start time - introduce yourself to participants as they arrive and let them know where to put fruit for you (if you want ⅓), and for fruit rescue recipients (put out boxes marked for Boulder Food Rescue fruit collection), show fruit tree(s) to harvest, set up a place for scales, sign in sheets, and, etc.
      <li>As people arrive, welcome and thank them for coming.  Read the description of activity/safety tips.
      <li>As volunteers harvest, keep an eye on activities to make sure that people are being safe and respectful of the property and the trees, reminding them of the rules if needed.
      <li>Keep an eye on time and the progress of the harvest and give people 15 and 5 minute countdowns if you will be going to a another location as you approach departure time.  Make sure to announce the address of the next location so people know where to go.  (You could print the address out or create a map if you wish.)
    </ol>
  
    <p>
      After the Community Fruit Rescue event:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Thank participants for their participation.
      <li>Pack up 1/3 of the fruit harvested for charity! 
      <li>If you will take fruit to a fruit rescue recipient, do so right away or put it in a bear-safe area overnight for next day delivery. Most recipients are open Mon.-Fri. 9am-5pm. Click here for recipient info.
      <li>If you need Boulder Food Rescue to pick up fruit, please put it by the curb. BFR will arrive between 3-5pm on your day of harvest to pick up fruit for donation.
      <li>Return any borrowed harvesting poles and fill out this debrief form.
      <li>Pat yourself on the back for being an awesome Community Fruit Rescue Home Harvest Coordinator!!!  We couldn’t do this without you!  Now treat yourself to some apple pie! ;)
    </ol>
